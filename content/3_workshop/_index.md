In this workshop, we will demonstrate DevOps in the cloud with AWS and JFrog. We will build and deploy a containerized NPM application. Using the JFrog Platform, we will compile our code, build our NPM package, execute a docker build and push, security scan the image and publish it to a repository. We will then deploy the image and serve the application with Amazon ECS.
