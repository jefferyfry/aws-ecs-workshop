We will now build a Docker image with our NPM package and publish the image to our JFrog Artifactory repository.

1. Return to your Cloud9 terminal. Let's create a Docker image for our NPM application. Let's create an environment variable for our image name. Substitute your _server name_ in the following command.
                                   
``
export image_name=<server name>.jfrog.io/docker-demo/npm-app:latest
``

2. Now let's build a docker image with the following command.

``
docker build -t $image_name .
``

This command should result in a successful Docker image build.

Docker Hub has set a new limit on data transfer beginning November 1st for free accounts: 100 pulls for anonymous users and 200 pulls for authenticated/free users for every 6 hours per IP address or a unique user.

Artifactory can protect you from this by proxying and caching images! This reduces the number of pulls from Docker Hub.

3. Now use the JFrog CLI to push the docker image.

``
jfrog rt docker-push $image_name docker-demo --build-name=npm_build --build-number=1
``

4. Now trigger a Xray scan of the build.

``
jfrog rt build-scan npm_build 1
``

This command should result in successful scanning.

5. If our build passes the Xray scan, we can promote it with the following command. This promotes from the _dev_ repository to the _prod_ repository. Substitute your _server name_ in the following command.

``
jfrog rt docker-promote npm-app docker-demo-dev-local docker-demo-prod-local --copy
``

6. In your JFrog Platform instance, go to **Artifactory** â–º **Artifacts** to see this in the docker repositories.
