      <description>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is the process for which your software components are built from code, integrated, tested, released, deployed and ultimately delivered to end-users. CI/CD pipelines are the software assembly line that orchestrates the building of your software. This CI/CD pipeline line requires infrastructure. Cloud computing has allowed this infrastructure to become dynamic and ephemeral. On cloud infrastructure, your CI/CD pipelines scale up and down to meet your software delivery demands.</description>

      <title>Binary Repository Management</title>

      <description>A Binary Repository Manager is a software hub that simplifies the development process for different teams across an organization by helping them to collaborate on building coherent and compatible software components. It does this by centralizing the management of all the binary artifacts generated and used by the organization, thereby overcoming the incredible complexity arising from diverse binary artifact types, their position in the overall workflow and the set of dependencies between them.</description>

      <description>Any security issue identified by a security scanning may be reviewed by a small security team that may lack the technical knowledge. This challenge can be reduced by shifting left to the developer and operations teams, making them also responsible for security and compliance. This moves security earlier in the software delivery process. Source code, dependency and artifact security scanning are some examples of moving security into the development process. Implementing the identification of security issues earlier in the CI/CD pipeline, as well as automating security and compliance policies in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), rather than using manual processes, is crucial.</description>

      <title>JFrog Platform for DevOps in the Cloud</title>
      <link>/2_devops_cloud/24_jfrog_platform_overview.html</link>

      <description>The JFrog Platform is designed to meet the growing needs of companies to develop and distribute software in the cloud. It provides DevOps teams with the tools needed to create, manage, secure and deploy software with ease. These tools cover everything from continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), binary repository management, artifact maturity, security and vulnerability protection (DevSecOps), release management, analytics and distribution.
JFrog Artifactory is an Artifact Repository Manager that fully supports software packages created by any language or technology.</description>

      <title>Configure AWS Secrets Manager for ECS</title>
      <link>/7_deploy_ecs/71_configure_ecs_secrets.html</link>

      <guid>/7_deploy_ecs/71_configure_ecs_secrets.html</guid>
      <description>In the previous sections, we set up the JFrog CLI to authenticate and publish Docker images to Artifactory. In the next sections, we will add the same Artifactory credentials to AWS Secrets Manager. We will then use an IAM Role to allow Amazon ECS to authenticate with Artifactory, pull the image and deploy it.
Private registry authentication for ECS tasks using AWS Secrets Manager enables you to store your credentials securely and then reference them in your container definition.</description>

      <title>Configure an IAM Role for ECS</title>

      <guid>/7_deploy_ecs/72_configure_ecs_role.html</guid>
      <description>We now have our Artifactory credentials in the AWS Secrets Manager. Next, we must create an IAM role that will allow ECS to access our Artifactory secrets and deploy our image.
Before you can launch ECS container instances and register them into a cluster, you must create an IAM role for those container instances to use when they are launched. The Amazon ECS container agent makes calls to the Amazon ECS API on your behalf using this role.</description>

      <description>The Amazon ECS first-run wizard guides you through the process of getting started with Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type. The wizard gives you the option of creating a cluster and launching your application. It is a great way to get started with deploying your application with Amazon ECS. We will use the wizard to deploy our NPM application Docker image from Artifactory.
 Go to the Amazon ECS console first-run wizard.</description>

      <description>JFrog CLI is a client that provides a simple CLI interface that automates the management of JFrog products. JFrog CLI works with JFrog Artifactory, JFrog Mission Control, JFrog Bintray and JFrog Xray (through their respective REST APIs) making your scripts more efficient and reliable. You can use the JFrog CLI to assist in your builds, create artifacts, promote artifacts, trigger security scans and much more. It is powerful to that you can use in your CI/CD process and general automation.</description>

      <title>Configure JFrog Artifactory and Xray</title>

      <guid>/4_workshop_setup/43_jfrog_setup/434_configure_jfrog.html</guid>
      <description>Now that we have the JFrog CLI installed and configured, we will use it to create the Artifactory NPM and docker repositories, Xray watches and policies. We will need these when we build and publish our NPM application later. The JFrog CLI uses the the JFrog Platform REST APIs. This is another way that you can manage and monitor the JFrog Platform.
 In your Cloud9 terminal, change directory to the aws-modernization-with-jfrog directory.</description>
